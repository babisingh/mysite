# Biography

My PhD research involved large scale analyses to understand the regulation of alternative splicing in cancer.
Alternative splicing is a mechanism that produces different proteins from same gene sequence and almost 95% of genes in humans undergo this process. However, in diseases like cancer this process produces disease variant of normal protein. We worked with RNAseq data of more than 4000 patients and 18 different tumor types, along with whole genome sequencing data of >400 patients to produce pan-cancer analysis of splicing changes and its regulation both at cis (mutations on DNA) and trans (differential expression of genes) levels. One of the first extensive studies done so far on alternative splicing and its mechanism of regulation through RNA binding proteins.
