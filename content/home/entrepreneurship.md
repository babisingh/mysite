In the beginning of 2018, I received an Erasmus Young Entrepreneurship award to learn social entrepreneurship. My interest in psychology, society and sewing lead me to work with a non-profit called Made in Carcere (Made in Prison). From six months I have been working inside maximum security prison in Italy with male and female detainees, together we design & develop fashion accessories such as handbags and t-shirts. It is an ongoing, life changing experience that I am observing in real-time, Among other things I am learning 1) how businesses run, 2) how prisons run and 3) how human psychology runs. I have much to say about this experience, if there are listeners.

The part that I enjoy the most about this Entrepreneur learning is to use the skills I developed through work, procrastination or hobbies together. I am writing codes, developing website, reading materials, making graphics, managing social media, designing and stitching clothes, researching & writing articles.. sometime all of it in a single day!

I would like to post few resources that helped me so far in understanding how people run businesses. It's a small list of tools that I found on internet (mostly r/entrepreneur on Reddit):

Here is the start that almost all business 'gurus' (shout out to Gary Vs and Tim Ferrises of business world) recommend to honestly ask yourself again and again.

- Why to be an Entrepreneur?
- Will it be a necessary contribution to the society?
- Do you have enough resources to start?
- What skills are you bringing on the table? What you'd need to outsource?

<u> First thing first: </u>

Primary research of the market : Important to get the reality check, can be done through interviews, surveys, questionnaires, (thorough) Google search, published research etc. Google Keywords search is also helpful to identify what's in demand, what people are searching.

Domain registration: Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains there are so many and it's also addictive as hell.


Email and Social media Configuration: Creating all social media handles (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Youtube..) with same name should be the simultaneous thing to do after registering the domain.


Web-hosting and website Development: I have tried GitHub to host pages because it's free and reliable but also there are different free hosting services to play around (like [Hostdrop](http://hostdrop.eu). Almost everyone suggests to stay away from 'free' webhosting services as often they are insecure and unreliable, but to play around (also, if you're lurking around jobless without savings), not that bad!


Social Media Manager : I prefer [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/) (free for upto three social media accounts), I've tried others as well but somehow this worked well for me.
