This section talks about personal expressions I discovered through art, travel and dancing.

If done right, traveling puts all [four psychological functions](https://www.google.it/search?q=four+psychological+functions+jung&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimxZeC_fDbAhUqMuwKHSz8CowQ_AUICigB&biw=1321&bih=606#imgrc=AbaJJqxeDvMrPM:) of an individual at work, I discovered this while discovering Europe (shout-out to Schengen!). Europe is pure art no matter which corner I turned, so best way to travel was to stop planning and start exploring. One summer backpacking from south of France to north of Italy, I reached [Perinaldo](https://imgur.com/a/NoiGhXQ), birth town of Cassini, just like that. On another occasion while randomly walking in a [park in Wurzburg](https://imgur.com/a/RQ9lLLT) (quite a small town in Germany), I found billboards of 14 Nobel laureates that were associated with the university of that small town, their work was on display in the park, like it's no big deal that this small town has hosted so many Nobel laureates! On another occasion while traveling in Florence, I encountered a temporary museum that had working models of [Vinci's machines](https://imgur.com/a/ykYtPhC) on display. When I finished my thesis I celebrated by walking [130 kms in 5 days](https://imgur.com/a/G0dnwpH) for Camino de Santiago, as usual without any planning or preparation (10/10 would do again but perhaps with more days and less bag weight).

Dancing is another form of expression that I absolutely enjoy. During my thesis years, I made commitment to learn atleast one dance form each year..so I learnt salsa, Bachata, Tango and Forró. Each dance style bring out different elements Salsa is energetic, Bachata = sensuality, Tango is my all time favorite, just an elegant walk on the rhythm and Forró is a Brazilian dance form .. so amazing that I wanted to travel Brazil just to listen this music and dance on it.  

Occasional session of [paintings](https://imgur.com/a/OzB6EFH) allow me to access and communicate through the internal 'unknown'. What I cannot speak, I paint or turn them into [dresses](https://imgur.com/a/ND7PolW), individual expression is a beautiful thing and it's insane how it has become a luxury.
