This section talks about personal expressions I discovered through art, travel and dancing.

If done right, traveling puts all [four psychological functions](https://www.google.it/search?q=four+psychological+functions+jung&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimxZeC_fDbAhUqMuwKHSz8CowQ_AUICigB&biw=1321&bih=606#imgrc=AbaJJqxeDvMrPM:) of an individual at work, I discovered this while discovering Europe (shout-out to Schengen!). There is just so much art and history scattered around in big cities and small towns that the best way to travel is to quit planning and start exploring. One summer backpacking from south of France to north of Italy, unknowingly I reached [Perinaldo](https://imgur.com/a/NoiGhXQ), birth town of Cassini and there was even an (astronomical observatory)[https://www.osservatoriocassini.it/] in his name. On another occasion while randomly walking in a [park in Wurzburg](https://imgur.com/a/RQ9lLLT) (quite a small town in Germany), I found placards for 14 Nobel laureates that were associated with the university of that small town, as if it's no big deal that this small town has hosted so many Nobel laureates! On another occasion while traveling in Florence, I encountered a temporary museum that had working models of [Vinci's machines](https://imgur.com/a/ykYtPhC) on display. There are multiple such examples of my chance encounters that left me astonished.

The pleasure (and perils) of hiking is another thing that I learned alongside my PhD. From my first ever trail straight to [via Ferrata](https://imgur.com/a/kZi2J32) in mountains of Catalunya, where embarrassingly enough I had to be rescued to catch few breaths, to [finally..(almost) getting it right](https://imgur.com/JzLEfCa) at the peaks of [Canigou of Pyrenees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canigou), this learning ironically became the symbolic phases of PhD. So, when I defended my thesis I celebrated it by [hiking towards Camino de Santiago]((https://imgur.com/a/G0dnwpH)), finishing 130kms of walking in 5 days (10/10 would do again but perhaps with more days and less bag weight).

Dancing is another form of expression that I absolutely enjoy and living in Barcelona made it easy to find a dancing place even if I finish work at 11pm. During my thesis years I learned salsa, Bachata, Tango and Forró. Each form reveals different elements, salsa is energetic, bachata is sensual, tango teaches the elegance of walking on the rhythm and Forró is a Brazilian dance form .. so amazing that I wanted to travel Brazil just to listen this music and dance on it.  

Occasional session of [paintings](https://imgur.com/a/OzB6EFH) allow me to access and communicate through the internal 'unknown'. What I cannot speak, I paint or turn them into [dresses](https://imgur.com/a/ND7PolW), individual expression is a beautiful thing and it's insane how it has become a luxury.
