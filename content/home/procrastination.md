Once during a [beer session](https://imgur.com/a/ugAWYi5), I overheard a conversation between two (extremely motivated) academics, "if you're doing something that does not directly contributes to your research, you're procrastinating". So, this is my selected list of 'procrastination', they kept me inspired.

### Science & Philosophy ###

-----------------------------------------------------

[A Short History of Nearly Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything) Most people start their journey towards science with this book but I read it quite late. This book was gifted to me from my [PI](https://twitter.com/EduEyras) when I defended my thesis. It's a classic. This book got me interested even in Lichens, and I was a zoology student before.

[Chance and Necessity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chance_and_Necessity) by Jacques Monod, the summary of this book is described better [here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/493746.Chance_and_Necessity).

[What Is Life?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Life%3F) by Erwin Schrödinger. Did a physicist laid the foundation for modern biology (DNA)? This book published in 1944(!) includes series of public lectures by Schrödinger. From order and disorder, entropy, biology, heredity, philosophy, determinism and free will, all my favorite topics covered.

Books by [John Gribbin](https://www.google.it/search?ei=zQ8IW_u6KMvBgAad2L2wBg&q=john+gribbin+books&oq=john+gribbin+books&gs_l=psy-ab.3...2656.3843.0.4177.6.6.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..6.0.0....0.M965BAEPQf4). Two books to mention specially, [Deep Simplicity: Bringing Order to Chaos and Complexity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/587906.Deep_Simplicity) and [Almost Everyone's Guide to Science](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1410338.Almost_Everyone_s_Guide_to_Science). Deep Simplicity was fascinating, it poked my curiosity to think in the direction of chaos, order, patterns and mathematical nature of biology. What else is there?

[Emperor of all Maladies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor_of_All_Maladies) and [The Gene](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276428-the-gene) by Siddharth Mukherjee, two extremely well written books. "If we regulate gene editing only in case of extraordinary suffering, what is 'extraordinary suffering' and who gets to decide the definition?", he asks in the book, The Gene. His writing covers science, story telling and philosophy, I wish he writes on neuroscience next.

[Cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos_(Carl_Sagan_book)) by Carl Sagan, “We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.”

### AI & Algorithms ###

### Psychology & Philosophy ###

-----------------------------------------------------

> *“Once upon a time, in some out of the way corner of that universe which is dispersed into numberless twinkling solar systems, there was a star upon which clever beasts invented knowing. That was the most arrogant and mendacious minute of "world history," but nevertheless, it was only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths, the star cooled and congealed, and the clever beasts had to die. One might invent such a fable, and yet he still would not have adequately illustrated how miserable, how shadowy and transient, how aimless and arbitrary the human intellect looks within nature. There were eternities during which it did not exist. And when it is all over with the human intellect, nothing will have happened.”*

― Friedrich Nietzsche

What if the search for truth leads beyond utilitarian checkpoints? Prof. Yodkowsky's [Twelve Virtues of Rationality](http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/) talks about developing an unbiased perspective in pursuit of truth, wherever it leads, to question what must be questioned and believe what must be believed. After skimming over works of influential thinkers & philosophers of 19th and 20th century, I stopped for in-depth reading into works of Carl Jung.

We all nerd out in something, mine happened to be [Carl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung). His rationality & scientific representation of studies related to experiences as subjective as dreams, always amazes me. His contributions in the field of psychology is fairly undermined and I'd say highly relevant in current world. There is a compiled ebook available by Princeton press for [The Collected Works of C.G. Jung](https://www.amazon.com/Collected-Works-C-G-Jung-Complete-ebook/dp/B00HQPHACS), if someone got an interest (and determination that Jung's work demand), I highly recommend. [Man and his symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_and_His_Symbols), [Modern Man in Search of a Soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Man_in_Search_of_a_Soul) and [Memories, Dreams, Reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memories,_Dreams,_Reflections) are good books to start with. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHx9i3sQD8Y) is Prof. Jordan Peterson describing Jung's work, exactly how I would have described it, starting with a skeptical mind then diving deeper and deeper, discovering the genius with an awe.

[Beyond Good and Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Good_and_Evil), and [Thus Spoke Zarathustra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra) by Nietzsche influenced my thinking a lot (even without having a Christian background, the work resonated). [Man's search for meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning) by Victor Frankl is another classic that stands out.


Among new authors, I like work of Sam Harris on [Free Will](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13259270-free-will) which is still a topic of debate in my head, as if the answer is not clear yet. Also, his podcast [Waking Up](https://samharris.org/podcast/) discusses wide range of topics that I like from AI to politics to nuclear war, topics as a society we must address sooner than later.

I also enjoy listening to [Dr. Jordan Peterson](https://jordanbpeterson.com/) both [videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/jordanpetersonvideos) and [podcast](https://jordanbpeterson.com/jordan-b-peterson-podcast/), a well read, well researched intellectual, Where are other academics like him hiding?



### Art & Literature ###

-----------------------------------------------------


I owe so much for my inspiration and growth to art and literature that I skipped in the chaos of India. I feel fortunate that during the time of my PhD, I lived in Barcelona where works of Miró, Dali, Gaudi and Picasso is spread around the city like it's so normal. I got so use to passing by Sagrada Familia on my way to dance classes that it sort of became a background noise, what a luxury that is! In Spain, I got aware about works of Cervantes, Lorca and Antonio Machado (in whatever Spanish I could understand). I also got to read work of Marx, Schopenhauer, Kant, Nietzsche, Freud, Adler and Jung (the few months that I spent in Germany, I returned with a list of philosophers to read and musicians to listen). Works of Italian artists and writers also fascinate me a lot, Michaleangelo, Dante, Vinci.. the list is long and I am still discovering. Recently, I developed interest in reading Greek mythology, ofcourse that's another Pandora's box and in future if time allows, I would like to experience more of French literature.


There are many books and topics I am consciously eliminating to avoid making it another section of Goodreads. As nothing of what I read represent any chronological order, I later found out there is also a scientist way to get acquainted a bit about everything (for reference purposes) through these series of DK publications:

* [The Literature book](https://www.dk.com/us/book/9781465429889-the-literature-book)

* [The Science book](https://www.dk.com/us/book/9781465419651-the-science-book)

* [The philosophy book](https://www.dk.com/us/book/9780756668617-the-philosophy-book)
