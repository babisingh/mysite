Science to me stands for curiosity. Our nearest ancestor apes have never attempted to ask questions, even when taught as many as 125 sign languages [1]. They can make & use tools, process food, collect water, make shelter but do not ask questions. Given the context, I won't judge whether humans are doing better or worse than apes, but here we are finding our way in the world through curiosity. Joseph Jordania in his book 'Who Asked The First Question?' concluded that "ability to ask question could be a crucial cognitive threshold between primates and humans. It gave us, as an individual and as a group, an evolutionary advantage through group cognition and mental cooperation" [2]. Suddenly, we had an edge over problem solving & therefore better survival. The story seems far from over, we are still struggling for better survival, it's not over yet and I believe, curiosity is what driving us. If we are not asking our 'whys' somebody else will be asking it for us. Isn't that a risk?

Indeed, we have come a long way from our immediate ancestors, dropping a few bombs here and there in the process but mostly doing good. We still have hunger and poverty, an unbalanced distribution of wealth and resources. Life is same but cost of life is different, diseases are same but treatments are different. Some struggle due to lack of medicines, some due to excess of it. Consumerism feeds me with everything I need (and do not need) and my ads have become hauntingly customized that I cannot help but click. Where is it all leading us?
