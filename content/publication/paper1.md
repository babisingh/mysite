abstract = "Alternative splicing is regulated by multiple RNA-binding proteins and influences the expression of most eukaryotic genes. However, the role of this process in human disease, and particularly in cancer, is only starting to be unveiled. We systematically analyzed mutation, copy number, and gene expression patterns of 1348 RNA-binding protein (RBP) genes in 11 solid tumor types, together with alternative splicing changes in these tumors and the enrichment of binding motifs in the alternatively spliced sequences. Our comprehensive study reveals widespread alterations in the expression of RBP genes, as well as novel mutations and copy number variations in association with multiple alternative splicing changes in cancer drivers and oncogenic pathways. Remarkably, the altered splicing patterns in several tumor types recapitulate those of undifferentiated cells. These patterns are predicted to be mainly controlled by MBNL1 and involve multiple cancer drivers, including the mitotic gene NUMA1. We show that NUMA1 alternative splicing induces enhanced cell proliferation and centrosome amplification in nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. Our study uncovers novel splicing networks that potentially contribute to cancer development and progression."

abstract_short = "\n\nMany normal proteins are transformed into their 'disease variants' in cancer and other diseases, i.e. they originate from same gene sequence but have antagonistic properties. How does it happen? To understand this, we studied specific group of proteins called RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that guide splicing process to create mRNA, which then creates protein. We wanted to understand 1) whether the working mechanism of these RBPs differ in cancer and 2) what kind of splicing alterations lead to disease variant of same proteins? In one of the largest studies done so far, we extracted information of all known RNA binding proteins, and studied with respect to genomics data of thousands of cancer patients for several cancer types.\n\n"
