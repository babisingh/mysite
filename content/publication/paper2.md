abstract = "A major challenge in cancer research is to determine the biological and clinical significance of somatic mutations in non-coding regions. This has been studied in terms of recurrence, functional impact, and association to individual regulatory sites, but the combinatorial contribution of mutations at common RNA regulatory motifs has not been explored. We developed a new method, MIRA, to perform the first comprehensive study of significantly mutated regions (SMRs) with overrepresented binding sites for RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in cancer. We found multiple RBP motifs, including SRSF10, PCBP1 and HNRPLL motifs, as well as a specific subset of 5’ and 3’ splice-site sequences, enriched in cancer mutations. Gene targets showed association to cancer-related functions, and analysis of RNA sequencing from the same samples identified alterations in RNA processing linked to these mutations. MIRA facilitates the integrative analysis of multiple genome sites that operate collectively through common RBPs and can aid in the interpretation of non-coding variants in cancer. MIRA is available at https://github.com/comprna/mira."

abstract_short = "\n\nCancer is a disease where mutations play a significant role but not all mutations are harmful, most of them are passive. One of the challenges is to interpret these mutations and to identify which of them will have downstream effect. We created a pipeline (MIRA) to systematically scan tiny fragments of sequences (k-mers) for mutations on every human gene and later performed analysis to identify which mutations were relevant for downstream effects.\n\n"
